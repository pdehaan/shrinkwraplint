# shrinkwraplint

Checks remote npm-shrinkwrap.json file against the [nodesecurity.io](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories) database.

Go to https://shrinkwraplint.herokuapp.com/ to see this in action.

The site in itself is pretty useless, but you can use something like [changedetection.com](http://www.changedetection.com/) to monitor a specific URL for changes and notify you via email if something changes (not the most efficient use of internets, but it works).
